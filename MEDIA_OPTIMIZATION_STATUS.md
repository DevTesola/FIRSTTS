# Media Optimization Status

## GIF Loading Issue Resolved ‚úÖ

The GIF files in the blog pages are now loading correctly. We've switched to a simpler component (`SimpleBlogMedia`) that directly loads GIF files without trying to find optimized versions first.

## Current Media Files

- `/public/ss/s1.gif` (5.0MB) - Used in: Gaming Partnership article
- `/public/ss/s2.gif` (6.6MB) - Used in: Meme Battle Governance article
- `/public/nft-previews/tsts.mp4` (1.7MB) - Used in: Token Launch article

## Optimization Needed üîß

The GIF files are quite large and should be optimized for better performance:

1. **Install FFmpeg** for media conversion:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg webp

   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg webp

   # Windows
   Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
   ```

2. **Run the optimization script** (once FFmpeg is installed):
   ```bash
   node scripts/optimize-blog-media.js
   ```

   This script will:
   - Convert GIFs to MP4 (much smaller, better quality)
   - Convert GIFs to WebP (smaller, animated)
   - Preserve original files as backup

3. **After optimization**, you can switch back to the optimized `BlogMedia` component which will automatically use the smaller MP4/WebP versions when available.

## Benefits of Optimization

- s1.gif (5.0MB) ‚Üí s1.mp4 (~500KB) - 90% smaller
- s2.gif (6.6MB) ‚Üí s2.mp4 (~600KB) - 91% smaller
- Faster page loads, especially on mobile
- Better performance scores
- Reduced bandwidth usage

## Current Status

‚úÖ GIF files are now loading properly with the simple component
‚ö†Ô∏è Media files need optimization for better performance
üì¶ Optimization script is ready at `/scripts/optimize-blog-media.js`
üîß Requires FFmpeg installation to run optimization

## Next Steps

1. Install FFmpeg and WebP tools
2. Run the optimization script
3. Test the optimized files
4. Switch back to the full `BlogMedia` component for automatic optimization benefits
