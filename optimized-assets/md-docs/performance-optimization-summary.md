# Performance Optimization Summary

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- Implemented image optimization with proper domains and patterns
- Simplified Content Security Policy to allow necessary resources
- Removed experimental features that could cause instability
- Added proper security headers

### 2. Component Architecture
- Created optimized Layout component with simplified rendering
- Modified BackgroundVideo component to have proper fallbacks
- Enhanced error handling in dynamic imports to prevent white screens
- Added suspense boundaries for improved loading states

### 3. Middleware Optimization
- Centralized and standardized middleware implementations
- Created optimized rate limiting with LRU cache
- Implemented proper caching with SWR pattern
- Enhanced security through consistent headers

### 4. Image and Media Handling
- Removed dependency on external image files
- Simplified asset loading to prevent render blocking
- Added background fallbacks for media content
- Implemented responsive image handling

## Encountered Issues

### 1. Middleware Configuration
- Duplicate middleware detection in Next.js
- Conflicts between middleware directory and middleware.js file
- Page-level middleware vs. app-level middleware complexity

### 2. Media Loading Problems
- Missing video and image assets causing render failures
- BackgroundVideo component trying to load non-existent files
- Video preloading causing performance issues

### 3. Dynamic Import Issues
- Error handling in dynamic imports needed improvement
- SSR compatibility with client-side libraries required fixes
- Wallet adapter components causing hydration mismatches

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Complete Media Asset Creation
- Create missing image assets for NFT and token banners
- Optimize video loading for the background videos
- Add proper placeholder images for progressive loading

### 2. Middleware Restructuring
- Consider migrating to the new Next.js middleware API
- Create a consistent pattern for API middleware usage
- Resolve duplicate middleware warnings permanently

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive load testing for the application
- Validate optimizations with real-world performance metrics
- Monitor for any remaining rendering issues

### 4. Additional Performance Enhancements
- Implement proper code splitting per page route
- Add service worker for offline capability
- Consider implementing React Server Components for applicable sections
