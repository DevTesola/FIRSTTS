# NFT Staking Dashboard Fix

## Problem Overview

The staking dashboard was experiencing several issues:

1. NFT ID inconsistency: NFTs displayed with incorrect IDs (e.g., NFT #0019 showing as #0008)
2. Missing staked NFTs: Some NFTs appeared in blockchain data but not in the dashboard
3. Database sync issues: Database constraints and missing data causing display problems
4. Reliance on database over blockchain: UI was dependent on potentially outdated or inconsistent database records

## Solution Approach

We implemented a multi-faceted approach to fix these issues:

1. Created an on-chain data API that bypasses the database completely
2. Developed a consistent NFT ID resolution utility 
3. Enhanced the staking dashboard to use on-chain data with fallback to database
4. Implemented a force-sync functionality to ensure database and blockchain are aligned
5. Updated the UI components to consistently display correct NFT IDs

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Direct On-Chain Data API

Created `/pages/api/staking/getOnchainStakingInfo.js` to:
- Connect directly to the Solana blockchain
- Find and decode the user's staking account
- Extract staked NFT addresses
- Get and decode individual staking accounts for each NFT 
- Format data in a structure compatible with the existing UI
- Return complete staking data without database dependencies

### 2. NFT ID Resolution Utility

Created `/utils/staking-helpers/nft-id-resolver.js` to:
- Extract NFT IDs from various sources using a priority-based approach
- Provide consistent ID resolution across components
- Handle different NFT naming formats and patterns
- Generate deterministic IDs from mint addresses as a fallback

### 3. Force-Sync API Endpoint

Enhanced `/pages/api/force-sync.js` to:
- Read staking data directly from blockchain
- Update database records to match on-chain state
- Use the improved NFT ID resolver for consistent IDs
- Implement a "sync" button in the dashboard UI

### 4. Dashboard Improvement

Updated `StakingDashboard.jsx` to:
- First try the on-chain API, with fallback to the database
- Ensure proper ID resolution for all staked NFTs
- Add ID-based sorting option
- Enhance debugging information

### 5. StakedNFTCard Enhancement

Updated `StakedNFTCard.jsx` to:
- Consistently use the resolveStakedNftId function
- Improve image URL generation and loading
- Add debugging information to help identify ID issues

## Results

The improvements have resolved the NFT dashboard display issues:

1. NFT IDs now display correctly (e.g., NFT #0019 shows as #0019)
2. All staked NFTs appear in the dashboard, matching blockchain data
3. The direct on-chain data API bypasses database issues
4. The sync button allows users to force alignment between UI and blockchain
5. The system is more resilient to database inconsistencies

## Technical Notes

- The on-chain data API uses the borsh serialization library to decode account data
- NFT ID resolution follows a priority hierarchy: explicit IDs → metadata → name → mint address
- The system now has multiple validation layers to ensure display consistency
- Database operations are performed using supabaseAdmin client for proper permission handling
- The solution preserves backward compatibility with existing code and APIs

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider a complete migration to on-chain data as the primary source of truth
2. Implement automatic sync jobs to keep database aligned with blockchain
3. Add further metadata enrichment through NFT registry lookups
4. Consider implementing a cache layer for frequently accessed on-chain data
5. Add more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms
