## Introduction

The goal of this optimization effort was to improve the mobile performance of staking-related components while maintaining full functionality. Special attention was paid to reducing re-renders, optimizing image loading, and ensuring responsive layouts.

## Key Optimization Techniques

### React Optimizations
- **useMemo**: Extensively used to memoize expensive calculations and component rendering
- **useCallback**: Implemented for event handlers to prevent function recreation on re-renders
- **Memoized Components**: Split large components into smaller, memoized sub-components
- **Dependency Optimizations**: Refined dependency arrays to avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Image Optimizations
- **ResponsiveImageLoader**: Created a smart component that selects between optimized and full versions based on device
- **MobileOptimizedImage**: Lightweight image component specifically designed for mobile devices
- **Cached URLs**: Implemented controlled cache busting to prevent unnecessary network requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Added intelligent lazy loading for off-screen images
- **Reduced Quality**: Lower image quality parameters for mobile devices to save bandwidth

### Mobile-Specific UI Optimizations
- **Simplified Rendering**: Reduced visual complexity on mobile devices
- **Optimized Data Points**: Reduced number of data points in charts and visualizations
- **Responsive SVG Charts**: Lightweight SVG-based charts that adapt to mobile screens
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only render what's needed based on screen size

## Component-Specific Optimizations

### 1. StakingRewards.jsx
- Replaced `EnhancedProgressiveImage` with `ResponsiveImageLoader` for NFT thumbnails
- Implemented consistent cache busting with a 5-minute interval
- Memoized reward calculations to prevent recalculation on each render
- Split large component into smaller memoized sub-components
- Added proper dependency arrays to useEffect and useMemo hooks
- Created a cacheBustValue system that refreshes only every 5 minutes to reduce image flickering

Key improvements:
```jsx
// Image URL processor function now memoized with consistent cache busting
const processImageUrl = useCallback((stake) => {
  // Processing logic with cached cache bust value
  return url;
}, [cacheBustValue]);

// Memoized states to avoid unnecessary re-renders
const calculatedValues = useMemo(() => {
  const totalEarned = isLoading ? "--" : (stats?.stats?.earnedToDate || 0);
  const claimableRewards = Math.floor(totalEarned);
  
  return { totalEarned, claimableRewards };
}, [isLoading, stats?.stats?.earnedToDate]);
```

### 2. StakingAnalytics.jsx
- Created constants for tier-specific colors to improve consistency and rendering
- Split large component rendering into smaller, memoized sub-components
- Optimized SVG chart generation for better mobile performance
- Reduced unnecessary data points in mobile chart visualizations
- Implemented useCallback for event handlers to prevent function recreation
- Correctly memoized complex chart paths to avoid recalculation
- Implemented responsive display of labels and data points based on screen size

Key improvements:
```jsx
// Memoized event handlers
const handleTimeframeChange = useCallback((newTimeframe) => {
  setTimeframe(newTimeframe);
}, []);

// Memoized chart component for specific views
const ProjectedRewardsChart = useMemo(() => {
  if (selectedChart !== 'rewards' || !analytics.projectedRewards) return null;
  
  // Chart rendering logic with screen-size considerations
  // ...
}, [selectedChart, analytics.projectedRewards]);
```

### 3. MobileOptimizedImage.jsx (New Component)
- Created specifically for staking pages on mobile devices
- Simplified rendering logic with reduced animation complexity
- Uses lower quality images by default to save bandwidth
- Optimized for performance with minimal features
- Reduced bundle size by removing unnecessary features
- Dynamically loads images at appropriate sizes for the device

Key advantages:
```jsx
// Mobile-specific image optimization
const imageUrl = processImageUrl(processedSrc, { 
  width: getOptimalImageSize(containerWidth, { 
    screenType: 'mobile',
    isHighQuality: false
  }),
  quality: quality,
  optimizeFormat: true,
  preferRemote: true
});
```

### 4. ResponsiveImageLoader.jsx (New Component)
- Smart component that chooses between mobile and desktop image components
- Uses device detection to automatically select the appropriate component
- Dynamically imports the mobile component only when needed
- Optimizes props passed to sub-components
- Handles all device detection logic in one place

Key advantages:
```jsx
// Device detection and component selection
const isMobile = useMemo(() => {
  if (forceDesktop) return false;
  if (forceMobile) return true;
  
  // Only run in browser context
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false;
  
  // Use mobile version for screens smaller than 640px
  return window.innerWidth <= 640;
}, [forceMobile, forceDesktop]);
```

## Performance Improvements

The optimizations yield the following improvements:

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**:
   - Lazy-loading mobile-specific components
   - Dynamic imports for screen-specific code

2. **Reduced Network Traffic**:
   - Lower quality images for mobile devices
   - Consistent cache busting to prevent unnecessary requests
   - Mobile-specific image dimensions

3. **Faster Rendering**:
   - Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimized dependency arrays
   - Conditional rendering based on device type

4. **Reduced Memory Usage**:
   - Mobile components with fewer features
   - Better cleanup of resources in useEffect hooks
   - Optimized SVG charts with fewer data points

5. **Better User Experience**:
   - Responsive layouts specifically designed for mobile
   - Faster initial load times
   - Reduced flickering with consistent cache handling

## Testing Considerations

When testing these optimizations, consider:

1. **Device Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices with various screen sizes
2. **Network Conditions**: Test under various network conditions (3G, 4G, etc.)
3. **Component Integration**: Ensure all staking components work together properly
4. **Functionality**: Verify all functional aspects work correctly across devices
5. **Visual Consistency**: Check visual consistency between desktop and mobile views

## Next Steps

Potential additional optimizations:

1. Implement virtual scrolling for large NFT lists in staking components
2. Add service worker caching for frequently used staking images
3. Consider server-side rendering for initial staking data
4. Implement code splitting for staking-specific logic
5. Add optimistic UI updates to improve perceived performance
