# NFT Image Fix Summary (Final Update)

## Problem
The NFT images in the staking dashboard were not displaying correctly. Instead of showing the actual NFT images from IPFS, they were showing local placeholder images. This issue persisted despite updates to utility functions and environment variables.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the hardcoded IPFS CID (Content Identifier) used in multiple places throughout the codebase. There were several different problems:

1. Hardcoded old CID (`QmZxNmoVrJR1qyCLY1fUXPRNfdMNeu7vKLMdgY7LXXHbZ3`) used in different parts of the codebase
2. Some components bypassing utility functions entirely and generating URLs directly
3. Utility functions being overridden by component-level URL generation
4. Inconsistent approaches to image URL creation across different components
5. Lack of direct logging to help identify which URL generation method was being used

Additional instances of hardcoded CIDs were found in:
- Mock data generation in the staking service
- API responses in getStakingStats.js
- Various utility functions that create image URLs
- Components directly generating image URLs

## Solution
Our solution evolved into a more aggressive approach after initial changes to utility functions didn't resolve the issue:

1. Created a dedicated environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_CID` to store the correct IPFS CID for NFT images: `bafybeihq6qozwmf4t6omeyuunj7r7vdj26l4akuzmcnnu5pgemd6bxjike`

2. Updated `utils/nftImageUtils.js` to use the environment variable instead of the hardcoded CID:
   - Replaced all instances of the old hardcoded CID with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_CID || 'bafybeihq6qozwmf4t6omeyuunj7r7vdj26l4akuzmcnnu5pgemd6bxjike'`
   - Modified the image URL generation code to use this CID consistently
   - Ensured the same CID is used across all methods that generate image URLs

3. Updated core components to forcibly generate correct IPFS URLs directly, instead of relying on utility functions:
   - Modified `components/staking/StakedNFTCard.jsx` to generate URLs directly based on NFT IDs
   - Updated `components/staking/NFTGallery.jsx` to use direct URL generation
   - Updated `components/staking/Leaderboard.jsx` with direct URL generation for all image displays
   - Added detailed console logging to help identify which URL generation method was being used

4. Used a consistent pattern for direct URL generation in each component:
   - Extract NFT ID from the available data
   - Format ID consistently (padding with zeros)
   - Get CID from environment variable with fallback
   - Construct the gateway URL with cache-busting parameter
   - Add detailed logging to help with debugging

5. Updated `services/stakingService.js` and `pages/api/getStakingStats.js` to use the environment variable for IPFS CID.

## The Direct URL Generation Pattern
We implemented this pattern in each component:

```javascript
src={(() => {
  // 무조건 NFT ID 기반으로 IPFS URL 직접 생성
  // 단순화된 강력한 로직: 항상 ID를 추출하여 직접 IPFS URL을 생성하는 방식으로 변경
  
  let nftId = entry.rank; // Extract ID from available data
  
  // 모든 상황에서 항상 직접 IPFS URL 생성
  const formattedId = String(nftId).padStart(4, '0');
  // 최신 환경 변수 사용 (하드코딩 제거)
  const IMAGES_CID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_CID || 'bafybeihq6qozwmf4t6omeyuunj7r7vdj26l4akuzmcnnu5pgemd6bxjike';
  const IPFS_GATEWAY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY || 'https://tesola.mypinata.cloud';
  const gatewayUrl = `${IPFS_GATEWAY}/ipfs/${IMAGES_CID}/${formattedId}.png?_cb=${Date.now()}`;
  
  // 로그로 생성된 URL 확인
  console.log(`❗❗❗ 강제 생성된 IPFS URL: ${gatewayUrl}`);
  console.log(`❗❗❗ 사용된 CID: ${IMAGES_CID}`);
  
  return gatewayUrl;
})()}
```

## Benefits
- Consistent handling of NFT image URLs across the entire application
- Direct URL generation in components bypasses any utility function issues
- Easier debugging with detailed console logging
- Cache-busting with Date.now() ensures fresh image loading
- Fallback to correct CID even if environment variable is missing
- Better separation of configuration from code
- More robust approach that doesn't rely on utility functions

## Testing
The solution has been implemented across all key components in the staking dashboard:
- Main StakedNFTCard component
- NFTGallery component
- Leaderboard component (top winners, main table, and reward tiers)

## Key Files Modified
- `/utils/nftImageUtils.js` - Updated to use environment variable for CID
- `/utils/mediaUtils.js` - Improved IPFS URL handling
- `/components/staking/StakedNFTCard.jsx` - Implemented direct URL generation
- `/components/staking/NFTGallery.jsx` - Implemented direct URL generation
- `/components/staking/Leaderboard.jsx` - Implemented direct URL generation for all image instances
- `/services/stakingService.js` - Updated to use environment variable for mock data
- `/pages/api/getStakingStats.js` - Fixed hardcoded CIDs in API responses

## Next Steps
1. Add the NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_CID environment variable to all deployment configurations
2. Consider adding validation to check for the presence of this environment variable during app startup
3. Update documentation to reflect the new environment variable requirement
4. Remove debug console logging after confirming the fix works in production
5. Consider implementing a centralized version of the direct URL generation pattern in a utility function for future use
