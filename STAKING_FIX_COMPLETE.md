# NFT Staking System Fix - Complete Implementation

## Summary

The NFT staking system has been fixed and enhanced to properly display staked NFTs and resolve image loading issues. The implementation includes both backend fixes for on-chain data retrieval and frontend enhancements for improved image loading.

## Issues Resolved

1. **Missing staked NFTs in dashboard**: Fixed by adding proper on-chain data retrieval through Solana PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
2. **NFT image loading issues**: Fixed by enhancing the image URL handling with proper IPFS gateway integration and cache busting
3. **Module path issues**: Fixed incorrect import paths in event subscription service
4. **PublicKey import issues**: Ensured PublicKey is properly imported in all necessary files

## Technical Changes

### 1. Event Subscription Service Fix

The `eventSubscriptionService.js` file had incorrect import paths for constants. Fixed by changing:

```javascript
import { PROGRAM_ID, DISCRIMINATORS } from '../utils/staking-helpers/constants';
```

to:

```javascript
import { PROGRAM_ID } from '../shared/constants/program-ids';
import { ACCOUNT_DISCRIMINATORS as DISCRIMINATORS } from '../shared/constants/discriminators';
```

This ensures that the service can properly subscribe to on-chain events and update the UI in real-time.

### 2. Enhanced Staking Dashboard

Created a new `EnhancedStakingDashboard.jsx` component that leverages the fixed event subscription service to provide real-time updates of staking data.

### 3. Improved API Endpoint

Enhanced `/api/staking/getStakingStats.js` to:
- Properly query on-chain data using PublicKey and PDA functions
- Synchronize database records with on-chain data
- Provide comprehensive NFT metadata and image URLs
- Implement proper error handling
- Add IPFS gateway URL generation with cache busting

### 4. Improved Image Loading

The `StakedNFTCard.jsx` component was enhanced to:
- Better handle IPFS URLs with proper gateway integration
- Add cache busting parameters to force image refreshes
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing images
- Display accurate NFT information from on-chain data

### 5. Test Page Integration

Added a new test interface in `test-staking.js` that provides:
- A toggle between staking setup and the staking dashboard
- Real-time updates from on-chain data
- Debugging information display
- Seamless transition from staking to viewing staked NFTs

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:

1. Connect your wallet on the `/test-staking` page
2. Stake an NFT using the staking interface
3. Switch to the "Staking Dashboard" tab to verify your NFT appears
4. Confirm the image loads correctly
5. Verify real-time updates work by making changes on-chain

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete unstaking workflow
2. Monitor performance for larger NFT collections
3. Consider adding additional features like auto-compounding and stake extension

## Files Modified

- `/services/eventSubscriptionService.js`
- `/components/staking/EnhancedStakingDashboard.jsx` (new)
- `/pages/test-staking.js`
- `/pages/api/staking/getStakingStats.js`

The implementation follows a modular approach, making it easy to extend with additional features in the future.
