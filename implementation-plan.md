# Detailed Implementation Plan for NFT Platform Improvement

## 1. NFT Minting Randomization System Improvement
- Implement safer randomization in purchaseNFT.js file
- Improve Supabase functions: Implement transactions using FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
- Add automatic lock release timeout mechanism (auto-release after 5 minutes)

## 2. Strengthen Duplicate Minting Prevention Mechanism
- Strengthen lock validation logic in completeMinting.js
- Add lock validity period check (expire locks older than 10 minutes)
- Ensure atomicity with database transaction processing
- Strengthen current state validation during state changes

## 3. Build Staking Synchronization System
- Implement blockchain-database synchronization helper functions
- Add automatic verification logic at staking completion
- Create cron jobs for periodic synchronization
- Implement discrepancy detection and automatic recovery functionality

## 4. Improve Error Handling and Recovery System
- Classify detailed error types and provide customized recovery methods
- Implement recovery utilities for failed minting and staking transactions
- Build recovery API endpoints
- Systematic error logging and monitoring

## Additional Recommendations
- Improve admin dashboard
- Build monitoring and notification system
- Implement regular data consistency checks
- Load testing and performance optimization
- Operational documentation and training
