# NFT Image Loading Fix Verification

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Changed `preferLocalFiles` default from `true` to `false` in `mediaUtils.js`**
   - The original problem in `mediaUtils.js` was that the `processImageUrl` function had a default parameter `preferLocalFiles: true` which was causing all IPFS URLs to be automatically converted to local images.
   - This has been fixed by changing the default to `false` at line 161.

2. **Ensured all components are using `preferLocalFiles: false`**
   - `EnhancedProgressiveImage.jsx` is now explicitly setting `preferLocalFiles: false` at lines 153 and 225 to ensure IPFS URLs are prioritized over local fallbacks.

3. **Fixed `getStakingStats.js` API to provide IPFS URLs**
   - The API now properly sets IPFS URLs as the primary image source at lines 117 and 130-132, ensuring that the `image` field contains an IPFS URL instead of a local path.

4. **Improved image prioritization in `nftImageUtils.js`**
   - The `getNFTImageUrl` function correctly prioritizes IPFS URLs (lines 117-131) over gateway URLs, other URLs, and local images.

5. **Enhanced fallback mechanism**
   - Local images are now used only as fallbacks when IPFS images fail to load, providing better user experience while still prioritizing authentic NFT images.

## Verification Process

The issue in the RewardsDashboard component was that when the same NFT object would be shown in different tabs, the "My NFTs" tab would display IPFS images while the "Rewards Dashboard" tab would display local fallback images.

This inconsistency was happening because:

1. The API responses were inconsistent - `getUserNFTs.js` API (used by "My NFTs" tab) was sending proper IPFS URLs while `getStakingStats.js` API (used by "Dashboard" tab) was sending local image paths.

2. The image processing utility in `mediaUtils.js` was automatically converting IPFS URLs to local paths due to the `preferLocalFiles: true` default parameter.

Now both issues have been fixed:
- The API responses are consistent, both including proper IPFS URLs
- The image processing utility prioritizes IPFS URLs over local paths

This ensures that the same NFT data will be displayed consistently across all tabs.

## Testing Considerations

When testing in a browser:
1. Check the browser console for image loading logs
2. Verify that NFT images in the "Rewards Dashboard" tab are loading from IPFS gateways rather than local paths
3. Confirm that the same NFT displays the same image in both "My NFTs" and "Rewards Dashboard" tabs
4. Verify fallback behavior still works by testing with known-invalid IPFS URLs

## Next Steps

The implemented solution ensures that IPFS images are properly prioritized while maintaining the fallback functionality for a seamless user experience.
