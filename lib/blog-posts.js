# TESOLA Governance: Your Voice Matters

## Introducing DAO Governance

TESOLA isn't just another meme coin - it's a community-driven ecosystem where every holder has a voice. Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance system puts the power in your hands.

![Governance Dashboard](/nft-previews/0171.png)
*The future of TESOLA is decided by you*

## How It Works

### Voting Power Calculation

Your voting power is determined by:

1. **Staked NFTs**: Each staked SOLARA NFT gives you voting rights
   - Common NFTs: 1 vote
   - Rare NFTs: 2 votes
   - Epic NFTs: 3 votes
   - Legendary NFTs: 5 votes

2. **Evolution Multiplier**: Evolved NFTs carry more weight
   - Basic Stage: 1x multiplier
   - Apprentice Stage: 1.2x multiplier
   - Veteran Stage: 1.5x multiplier
   - Master Stage: 2x multiplier
   - Legendary Stage: 3x multiplier

3. **Staking Duration Bonus**: Long-term stakers earn bonus votes
   - 30+ days: +10% voting power
   - 90+ days: +25% voting power
   - 180+ days: +50% voting power

![Voting Power Example](/nft-previews/0327.png)
*Example: A Master-stage Epic NFT staked for 180 days = 9 votes!*
